# Welcome to kittr
test

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- If you are on Windows, make sure that you switch your Docker Desktop to Linux containers. You won't be able to spin up the docker compose containers without it!
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- yarn

## Installation

1. Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/kittrgg/kittr.git
```

2. Checkout the migration branch

```
git checkout migration
```

3. Let's get your environment variables set up. Navigate in your file explorer to `/scripts/createEnvironment/inputs`.

- Copy the `example.env.json` file to a new file called `dev.env.json`.
- Provide values for `TWITCH_CLIENT_ID` and `TWITCH_SECRET`.
  - We can't provide you with these values because they are indiviual to you. To get your Twitch tokens, visit [your Twitch developers console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps) and create an application token. (For the URLs that it asks for, you can use http://localhost:3000.)

4. Run `yarn install`.

5. Run `yarn env:dev`.

6. Run `yarn dx`.

7. If this is your first time developing kittr, you will need to seed your local Mongo instance at this time. To do so, open a new shall and use `yarn dx:mongo-seed`. You should get a message saying "Let's get kittd."

8. Now, run `yarn dx:db-seed` in that new shell, too. This takes the data from MongoDB to Postgres so you can use it for our migration.

9. Visit kittr at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Notes

- Existing login credentials to get into the dashboard:
  - Username: anthony@dev.com
  - Password: 123123
- A few channels that you may find useful:
  - ALLKITS - Features every kit in the database (well, almost) (may no longer be in the seed...)
  - brandnewchannel - A fresh, empty channel that was just created
  - anthonyshew - A channel that features multiple managers so you can see how the dashboard changes based on the user's role in that channel

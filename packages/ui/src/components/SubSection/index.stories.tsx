      One day, our founder, Anthony, was watching some Warzone channels on
      Twitch. He used an !amax command to try to find out about a channeler's
      CR-56 AMAX setup (classic 2020). In most of the channels he watched,
      though, when viewers asked for a channelerâ€™s kits in chat, they were given
      the link to...an ugly Google Sheet that was hard to read and interact
      with. Let it be known: Anthony is a web developer. As he struggled to
      learn about this AMAX, all he could think to himself was "Is there not a
      better way to do this?" The idea for kittr was born.

      Anthony quickly enlisted the help of his sister, a then-budding web
      designer. She was just learning the craft at the time - but Anthony
      promoted her to the big leagues right then and there. As it turns out
      Ashley is a complete all-star designer so she made all of the beautiful
      design for the website that you see.

      that video game channelers have been waiting for. We hope you like it as
      much as we do.

      unconventional as it wasn't your standard slay-fest...

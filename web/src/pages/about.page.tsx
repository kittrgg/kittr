			<H1>ABOUT</H1>

				<Container style={{ gridColumn: "span 3" }}>
					<H2>OUR STORY</H2>
					<p>
						One day, our founder, Anthony, was watching some Warzone channels on Twitch. He used{" "}
						<strong>an !amax command</strong> to try to find out about a channeler's CR-56 AMAX setup (classic 2020). In
						most of the channels he watched, though, when viewers asked for a channeler’s kits in chat, they were given
						the link to...an ugly Google Sheet that was hard to read and interact with. Let it be known: Anthony is a
						web developer. As he struggled to learn about this AMAX, all he could think to himself was "Is there not a
						better way to do this?" The idea for kittr was born.
					</p>
					<p>
						Anthony quickly enlisted the help of his sister, a then-budding web designer. She was just learning the
						craft at the time - but Anthony promoted her to the big leagues right then and there. As it turns out Ashley
						is a complete all-star designer so she made all of the beautiful design for the website that you see.
					</p>
					<p>
						Today, kittr is the <strong>kit sharing solution</strong> that video game channelers have been waiting for.
						We hope you like it as much as we do.

					<H2>WHAT WE DO</H2>
					<p>
						kittr is the place for channelers to{" "}
						<strong>easily share kits with their communities in a really nice looking way.</strong> We took it upon
						ourselves to enhance the Twitch experience for viewers, mods, and channelers alike. By providing an
						easy-to-use dashboard for channelers and moderators to create and edit kits, everyone wins!

					<H2>WHO WE SERVE</H2>
					<p>
						Twitch <strong>channelers</strong>, <strong>moderators</strong>, and <strong>viewers</strong> all love using
						kittr because it looks great and is easy to use. But don't take our word for it. Check out the channels of
						the channels on <Link href={Routes.CHANNEL.LIST}>our channels</Link> and watch kittr in action. We think
						you'll be convinced.
					</p>

				<Container style={{ gridColumn: "span 3" }}>
					<H2>OUR MISSION</H2>
					<p>
						We strive to create a <strong>better channeling experience</strong> for Twitch channelers, moderators, and
						viewers alike. Before kittr, there wasn’t a great way for channelers to share their kits with viewers. It’s
						2021 - Google Sheets just won’t cut it. But don’t worry, we here at kittr have got your back.
